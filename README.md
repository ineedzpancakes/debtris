# DEBTRIS: PAY TO SPIN

### The classic Puzzle Block Game with a Capitalistic Twist!

**DEBTRIS** takes the traditional block-stacking, line-clearing game to a whole new level with an added financial challenge! Rotate your tetrominoes strategically using a limited cash pool that replenishes periodically. Every spin has a price—manage your cash wisely, or you’ll be stuck with an immovable piece until your next “paycheck.”

## How to Play

1. **Control the Tetrominoes:**
   - **Move Left/Right:** Use the **arrow keys** to slide the piece.
   - **Hard Drop:** Press the **space bar** to instantly drop a tetromino.
   - **Rotate:** Use the **Z** and **X** keys to rotate. Each rotation deducts from your cash balance!
   - **Pause:**  Use the P or Esc keys to pause your game.

2. **Manage Your Cash:**
   - You start with a set amount of cash that is used to rotate tetrominoes.
   - Every rotation costs a portion of your cash, so think carefully before spinning!
   - If you run out of cash, you’ll have to wait 15 seconds for your next “paycheck” to continue rotating.

3. **Strategic Spending:**
   - Balance spending on rotations to maximize your line-clearing potential without going broke.
   - Use your funds efficiently, as excessive spinning on one piece could cost you valuable time and options.

## Features

- **HUD (Heads-Up Display):** Track your score, level, lines cleared, remaining cash, and countdown to your next “paycheck.”
- **Mobile Support:** Now playable on mobile devices! Tap and swipe to control your tetrominoes—play anytime, anywhere.
